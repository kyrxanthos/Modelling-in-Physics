# Modelling in Physics

A University of Edinburgh's [Course](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cxphys10035.htm) on mapping a scientific problem onto a computer algorithm to enable it to be modelled. The problems include the 2D Ising Model, Game of Life, SIRS, PDEs. 

For each problem navigate to the dedicated directory for instructions on how to run the simulations.

## Sample Results

### Ising Model:

### Game of Life:

### SIRS:

### Cahn Hilliard PDE:
